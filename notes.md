### (i) List of candidates closest to externality via distribution in climate macro literature

- **Giglio, Kelly, Pruitt (2016)** - *Systemic Risks and Shocks to the Real Economy*  
  Focuses on systemic risks and their effects on the economy, relevant for understanding externalities in climate economics.

- **Barnett et al. (2021)** - *Three Alternative Uncertainty Channels*  
  Discusses uncertainty in climate models through carbon dynamics, temperature dynamics, and damage functions.

- **Lemoine and Traeger (2016)** - *Regime Shifting in the Climate System*  
  Examines the potential for climate regime shifts and their implications for economic modeling.

- **Cai and Lontzek (2019)** - *Integrating Uncertainty in DICE-type Models*  
  Incorporates uncertainty into integrated assessment models (IAMs), especially regarding the impacts of climate change.

- **Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2019)** - *Effect of Climate Risks on Asset Pricing*  
  Investigates how climate risks affect asset pricing and financial markets.

- **Weitzman (2014)** - *Fat Tails and the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)*  
  Analyzes the implications of fat-tailed distributions in climate models and its impact on the SCC.

- **Hassler, Krusell, and Olovsson (2018)** - *IAM with Sensitivity Analysis*  
  Provides a sensitivity analysis of IAMs to better account for uncertainty in climate-economic models.

- **Jurado, Ludvigson, and Ng (2015)** - *Measuring Uncertainty*  
  Introduces a framework for measuring uncertainty in economic models, with applications to climate change.

### (ii) Constrained Inefficiency  
- “Constrained-Efficient Allocations in the Growth Model with Idiosyncratic Shocks”, with
Julio Davila, Jay Hong and Per Krusell. Econometrica, Vol. 80, No. 6 (November, 2012),
pp. 2431-67.

---

### (iii) Sabine Mauderer (NGFS)  
- **Mauderer (2024)** - *Climate Macroeconomic Modelling Handbook (NGFS)*  
  A comprehensive overview of climate macroeconomic modeling techniques and frameworks, published by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).







## 10/29/2024 : Con Andrés

**To Do:**
- Do the literature review to identify the paper closest to this of externality via probability idea in climate-macro literature.
- Look into the idea of constraned subobtimality and its application in macroeconomic literature. 
- How has the climate change literature dealt with undertainty with distribution?

**Other comments:**
- The idea is very interesting, should pursue it.
- Hold on to writing a model for now and do the literature review instead.
- When thinking of changing the underlying distribution, rather than the externality affecting just the moments like mean or variance of some known distribution, allow for the distribution to change from a finite variance known distribution to an infinite variance fat-tailed distribution.

## 10/26/2024

We discussed the idea. We talked about Andrés’ paper. We have a first approach. Two countries. The externality affects the climate TFP part.

Next goals: talk to Andrés about this.

Mati: incorporate last meeting https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tw9zAmwC4EtiMD5HdX8g6I5n63Euk8bFHcqwRX-vix0/edit?tab=t.0.


## 09/25/2024

**To Do:**
- Set up GitHub, Overleaf, and add slides.
- Meet with Andres (JMP + project logistics).
- Literature Review.

**Key Questions:**
- GE effect of an environmental externality through TFP probabilities?
- Explore TFP probabilities and their GE effects.

**Action Items:**
- Read Andres's paper.
- Brainstorm research ideas.

**Logistics:**
- Next meeting: Tue, Oct 15 (Macro-Environmental Reading Group).
- Invite papers and refine project ideas.

**Matias's Work:**
- Local impacts of natural disasters vs. climate change shocks.
- Probabilistic externalities (second project).

**Shisham’s JMP:**
- Focus: Endogenizing matching frictions, collaboration with Bushnell and Smith.
- DMP paper (paused), GSR in winter.

## 09/06/2024
- Develop ideas around GE and externalities, including QE chapter.

**Strengths/Weaknesses:**
- **Mati:** Strong in DSGE modeling, MATLAB, math; wants to learn Stata/model creation.
- **Shisham:** Strong in modeling and calibration; wants to improve micro-level data analysis and literature contributions.
