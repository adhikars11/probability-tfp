# Meeting Notes

## 09/25/2024

### To Do:
- Create GitHub for the project.
- Upload meeting notes on GitHub.
- Set up Overleaf and add slides.
- Meet with Andres (discuss JMP and project logistics).
- Work on Literature Review.

### Big Questions:
- What is the GE effect of an environmental externality through TFP probabilities?
- Investigate TFP probabilities and their relation to GE effects.

### Action Items:
- Both: Read Andres’s paper for insights.
- Formulate specific ideas for research.

### Logistics:
- Next meeting: Tue, Oct 15.
- Join Macro-Environmental Reading Group.
- Invite papers, send a list of relevant papers, and elaborate on ideas.

### Matias’s Work:
- **Topic 1**: Local impacts of natural disasters (natural vs. climate change shocks: temperature, drought, storms).
- **Topic 2**: Probabilistic externalities (second project).

### Shisham’s JMP:
- Focus on endogenizing matching frictions.
- Collaboration with Bushnell and Smith.
- Write up DMP paper (currently on pause).
- GSR in winter.

## 09/06/2024:
- Focus on GE and externality ideas.
- Approach: Develop a clear plan with milestones.
- Consider including this in QE chapter.

### Strengths/Weaknesses:
- **Mati**:
  - Strengths: DSGE model, moment calibration, math/derivation, MATLAB.
  - Weaknesses: Stata (wants to learn modeling and idea creation).

- **Shisham**:
  - Strengths: Modeling, calibration, counterfactuals.
  - Weaknesses: Stata, micro-level data analysis (wants to enhance literature contributions).
